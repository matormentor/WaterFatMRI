# WaterFatMRI 

Novel Water Fat 3D Separation for MRI signals using one Echo developed for Ultra Short Echo Time

### Presented research in ISMRM 2024



## Usage

The **Analysis** folder contains all the *already* processed signal manipulation and visualization 
The **Water Fat Lib** contains all the necessary logic for the method, optimization, image processing and machine learning methos

## Dependencies

There is a small dependency on the **BMRR Python** library which is not included in the package. But can be refactored easily using any type of class/struct and DICOM parser.

## Hypothesis

Initialization of a non-linear second order optimization method used to capture the unwanted phase contributions form the MRI scan helps improve the convergence path while increasing computational space and time efficiency
